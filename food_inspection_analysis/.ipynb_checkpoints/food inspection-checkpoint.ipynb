If there are clusters of violations, either through interactive visualization or by manually inspecting the data, look at the types of violations where there are clusters. Are there any trends? Write 2-4 sentences with your observations. If you did not use interactive visualization, explain how you explored trends in violation type by area. You may also create a second map showing violation types."

When multiple columns are combined, separate the columns and duplicate the location information. For example, the column \"Red Blue\" that contains \"Pallet Town\" will become two columns-- \"Red\" with location \"Pallet Town\" and \"Blue\" with location \"Pallet Town.\" Transpose the DataFrame so the video game (e.g. \"Red\") is the column name."
